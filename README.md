# Great-Gatsby-Analysis
## File Overview
- _projR.R_ is the main/master file, running it should complete the entire lab at once
- _init.R_ loads the cleaned dataset and installs all necessary packages

Everything else is described in the comments of the main file.

## The Dataset

The first three chapters of the Great Gatsby as .txt files.
